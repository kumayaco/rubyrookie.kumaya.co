*started from P. 56*

A `Hash` is a *dictionary-like* collection of unique `key`s and their `value`s. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to `Array`s, but where an `Array` uses integers as its index, a `Hash` allows you to use **any object type**.

### Basic Miscs

Using `key`s to map to `value`s and construct a dictionary

```ruby
dictionary = {'Fish' => 'in water', 'Rabbit' => 'not in water'}
```

#### Get Size

```ruby
puts dictionary.size
```

```sh
2
```

#### Get Value by Key

```ruby
puts dictionary['Fish']
```

will get

```
in water
```

#### Assign New Value


```ruby
dictionary['Rabbit'] = "fluffy animal"
puts dictionary['Rabbit']
```

will get

```
fluffy animal
```

### Hash Iteration

using `each` just like `Array` does

```ruby
a = { "a" => 1, "b" => 2 }
a.each {|key, value| puts "#{key} equals #{value}"}
```

will get

```
a equals 1
b equals 2
```
